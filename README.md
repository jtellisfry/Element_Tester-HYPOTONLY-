# Element-Tester
This will be a program for the Frymaster Element Tester to test the high potential and resistance.

## Important Testing Information
- This program uses UT61xP for communicating with a meter so that it can get the resistance readings.
- The point below doesn't work at the moment because the UT61xP application is UAC protected and I haven't found a way around that to open it
  
- There is logic in the Task Scheduler where it opens the UT61xP application with the heightened privileges and then theres another scheduled task that runs the "launch_and_connect.py" python file
  - If this doesn't happen or something interrupts it then it won't measure correctly (but there will be logic in the fail message for when this occurs to inform)

## If you are trying to rebuild a new executable file (.exe file) after changing something use this process
- Step 1: Open command prompt or powershell
- Step 2: Run this command --> cd "C:\Files\element tester\Element_Tester\src\element_tester\system\core"
- Step 3: Activate the virtual environment with these commands in that order and you should see a (.venv) appear in front of the location you cd into -->
  - SetExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
  - & "C:\Files\element tester\Element_Tester\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
- Step 4: Run this command --> python build_application.py
  - This should build and overrite the previous version of the application
